## Overview
Lopaka is a browser based editor that auto generates code for TFT display, making the creation process much easier ands simpler. It's a great tool for fast prototypes and early testing. 

## Setup
This folder contains three sketches:
1. *Lopaka_Base_Code* can be used as a template/skeleton to create new Lopaka projects, it contains all the necessary imports and functions
2. *Example1_Loading_Screen* contains the code of the first example from the YouTube video: a simple loading screen animation
3. *Example2_BMP280* contains the code of the second example from the YouTube video: a integration of a BMP280 sensor

To use the code, set the *ProjectFolder* as your *Sketchbook Location* in the Arduino IDE.
